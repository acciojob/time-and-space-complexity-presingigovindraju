    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        When analyzing algorithms, we often consider two important aspects: time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity grows at a reasonable rate as the input size increases, allowing it to handle larger inputs without excessive delays.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, deals with the amount of memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It's essential to manage memory usage, especially in resource-constrained environments. One common way to measure space complexity is using Big O notation, denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. For some algorithms, space complexity can be as critical as time complexity in determining their overall efficiency.
        <b>Space Complexity</b> plays a crucial role in designing algorithms that make efficient use of memory resources while solving complex problems.
